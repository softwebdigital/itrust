              communicate with us:</p>
            <p><strong>Click on the links below to jump to specific sections:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Identity Data includes your full name, date of birth, gender, identity numbers, and  other data on
                  government-issued identification documents.  </li>
                <li>Contact Data includes your email address, mailing address, and telephone numbers.  </li>
                <li>Financial Data includes your bank account and payment card details, suitability information, and
                  information about your income, account balances, financial transaction history, credit history, tax
                  information, and credit scores.  </li>
                <li>Profile Data includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your knowledge
                  assessment results, and your interests, preferences, feedback, and survey responses.  </li>
                <li>Usage Information includes information about how you access and use our Services, such as your
                  actions on the Services, including your interactions with others on the Services, photos or media
                  you upload to the Services, your username, and other content you provide (“Usage Information”). We
                  only access your device camera roll and camera with your permission. If you need to update your
                  permissions, you can do so in your device’s settings. Please remember that Itrust may, but has no
                  obligation to, monitor, record, and store Usage Information to protect your safety or the safety of
                  other users, to assist with regulatory or law enforcement efforts, to protect and defend our rights
                  and property, or for other reasons relating to our provision of the Services. By using the Services,
                  you consent to the recording, storage, and disclosure of such information you send or receive for
                  these purposes.</li>
                <li>Contact List Information With your permission, we may access your contact list on your mobile
                  device or in your email accounts so that you can identify your contacts on the Services and direct
                  the invitation of your contacts. We store and use this information to suggest referrals or
                  connections and for other reasons related to our provision of the Services. We make these
                  recommendations based on your contact list information as well as, with their consent, your
                  contacts’ information if they are also a Itrust customer. We only access your contact list
                  information with your explicit permission. If you provide us with personal data from your
                  third-party contacts, it is your responsibility to ensure that the communication of such data to,
                  and further processing by, Itrust is lawful. For example, when you provide us with information about
                  your contacts, we may use it to let you know which of your contacts have also signed up for our
                  Services or, at your exclusive direction, send messages to your contacts regarding our Services. We
                  will not send messages to your contacts that are not explicitly directed by you.  </li>
                <li>Additional Information: includes information that you submit via focus groups,
                  contests/sweepstakes, job applications, customer support, or other similar means. We may also
                  collect any communications between Itrust and you (including recording calls made to or by Itrust)
                  and any other information you provide to Itrust.   </li>
                <li>Personal Information Collected Automatically: As is true of many digital platforms, we collect
                  certain personal information automatically when you visit our online services, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Location Data:  To help us protect against fraud, provide our services to you, and improve our
                      services, we collect location data, including current and historical information concerning a
                      user’s geographic location, GPS location, transaction location, and IP addresses that they use
                      in conjunction with our Services. We collect your precise location data with your permission,
                      and use that information, for example, to help protect against fraud by detecting and declining
                      debit card transactions that may occur far away from your device’s location. We collect
                      information about your location through GPS, Wi-Fi, wireless network triangulation, or other
                      methods to obtain your location. We may also approximate your location by your IP Address. We
                      also use the Google Maps API to gather information about your location. Google uses various
                      technologies to determine your location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may,
                      for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell
                      towers (see Google’s Privacy Policy to learn more).  </li>
                    <li> Usage and Device Data Collected Automatically Through Tracking Technologies:  To provide a
                      personalized and enhanced user experience, we, and our third-party partners, automatically
                      collect certain types of usage information when you visit or use our Services, read our emails,
                      or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking
                      technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, location
                      identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, “Tracking
                      Technologies”). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as
                      your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating
                      system, date and time stamp, a unique ID (that allows us to uniquely identify your browser,
                      mobile device, or your account), and other similar information. We use Tracking Technologies to
                      help ensure that you have a high-quality experience on our Services. We also use Tracking
                      Technologies to aid in the targeted advertising of our services on other platforms. From your
                      device manufacturer, we also may collect the names of other third-party applications that you
                      have downloaded on your device.  If you prefer, you can change your cookie settings. Some
                      browsers have options that allow the user to control whether the browser will accept cookies,
                      reject cookies, or notify the user each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies
                      by adjusting your settings but doing so will limit the range of features available to you on our
                      Services and other websites. Be sure to read any information provided by your browser developer
                      to understand the limitations of these settings, as they may differ from browser to browser and
                      may not apply to all technologies. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic
                      downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have
                      accessed our email, used our Services, or performed certain functions with it.</li>
                    <li>Our Services also occasionally use “local shared objects” (also known as “Flash cookies”).
                      Like browser cookies, Flash cookies may be used for coordinating content delivery, website
                      functionality, maintaining preferences, advertising, or analytics. Unlike browser cookies,
                      “Flash cookies” are not stored in the browser. You may be able to manage these Flash cookies by
                      visiting the Adobe website here.</li>
                    <li>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals
                      to websites. We currently don’t take action in response to these signals.</li>
