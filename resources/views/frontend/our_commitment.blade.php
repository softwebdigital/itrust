          <p>We provide protection for your holdings.</p>
          <p>Itrust Investment and Itrust Securities are members of SIPC, which protects securities customers of its
            members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). Explanatory brochure available upon
            request or at www.sipc.org.</p>
          <p>In addition to SIPC protection, Itrust provides its brokerage customers with additional "excess of SIPC"
            coverage through certain underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, which provides an aggregate of $100 million of
            coverage—up to $1.5 million for cash and $10 million for securities per customer. The excess coverage
            would only be triggered when SIPC coverage is exhausted.</p>
        </div>
        <!--/column -->
        <div class="col-lg-6 gx-xl-20">
          <p>Note: Like SIPC coverage, this “excess of SIPC” policy does not protect against a loss in the market
            value of securities.</p>
          <p>If you are enrolled in Cash Management, please note that your cash is covered by SIPC until it is swept
            to a program bank. Your cash is not covered by SIPC when on deposit at a program bank, but is instead
            protected by FDIC insurance up to a total of $1.25 million—or up to $250,000 per bank, subject to FDIC
            rules.</p>
          <p>Cryptocurrency investments through Itrust Crypto are not protected by SIPC or FDIC. We carry crime
            insurance that covers a portion of the cryptocurrency held across our storage systems against losses from
            theft, including cybersecurity breaches. The policy is underwritten by certain underwriters at Lloyd’s of
            London, the world’s leading insurance marketplace.</p>

          <p>“Unauthorized activity” does not include activity (e.g., trades, deposits, withdrawals, or changes in
