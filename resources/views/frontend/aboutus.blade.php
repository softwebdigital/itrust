          <p>We founded Itrust in the wake of the financial crisis because we identified a gap - the more you had, the
            better deal you got.</p>
          <p>We aim to give everyone access to the financial system, regardless of their background or bank account
            balance. That’s why we have uniform interest rates, no account minimums, and a product that was designed
            from the ground up for small accounts.</p>
          <p>We would rather serve many small customers over a few large ones. We reflect the world around us, and we
            elevate and embrace all voices so everyone feels at home at Itrust.</p>

          <h3 class="display-5 mb-5">Itrust is a safety-first company</h3>
          <p>The reliability of our platform takes precedence over all else, so that we can be there for our customers
            when they need us the most. We relentlessly protect our customers’ security and privacy, and we only share
            with our counter parties what they need to fulfil our customers’</p>
          <p>financial needs, nothing more. We build safeguards and provide education so that our customers are in the
            best position to succeed. We have high quality timely customer support, and when things aren’t right,
            wefix them. We work closely with regulators and lawmakers to protect our customers and the broader
            financial system.</p>
          <p>We speak simply, plainly, and truthfully, even if it’s not what others want to hear. We hold ourselves
            and our colleagues to the highest ethical standards.</p>

        <p>From the early days of Itrust, we have prioritized getting direct customer feedback on what we were
          building. Talking to our customers forms the kernel of the product development process we have today. We
          listen with empathy, ask questions, and critically evaluate our work by how valuable our customers find it.
        </p>
        <p>We never stop asking how we can make our product better, and we never settle for ‘good enough’. We listen
          to our colleagues, and we start from a place of believing they are capable and well-intentioned.</p>
        <p>We delight our customers and take pride in our work. Otherwise, why even be here?</p>

        <p>Our foundation is in art, science, and pure mathematics, and we have a deep appreciation for the scientific
          process. We develop hypotheses and design experiments to test them. We reduce complex problems to their
          constituent bits.</p>
        <p>We debate vigorously and change our minds when confronted with the right evidence. We bravely do what’s
          right, even when it hasn't been done before. We treat our company like a product and aim to get better,
          every single day.</p>
