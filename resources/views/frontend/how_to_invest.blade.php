          <p>If you invest now, you’ll have a better chance to realizing a return on your investment. According to the
            Social Security Administration, Social Security benefits will only cover about 33% of the cost of the
            average American’s retirement. The rest will have to be filled in by personal savings and return on
            investments.</p>
          <p>There’s more to invest for than retirement. Investing can also help you buy a home, travel, start a dream
            project or even pay your bills in the future. If you invest in the stock market, you’ll have a better
            chance of watching your investment grow over the long term. And if you invest in bonds, you can benefit
            from a steady stream of income.
            Investing is a long-term venture. Short-term profits are elusive – and often illusory. The longer
            investment horizon you’re willing to cultivate, the better chance you will have to realize extended
            annualized returns on your investments.</p>
          <p>When you’re at different stages of your life, you will likely have different investment goals. When
            you’re young and have most of your earnings years ahead, you may want to build up capital to safeguard
            your future. Later, if you get married and have children, you may prioritize supporting your family as
            well as planning for your children’s college educations. As you get older, you’ll likely focus on
            financing your retirement. When mapping out your investment plans, consider which primary goals you want
            to focus on at your current age.</p>

              <li><i class="uil uil-arrow-right"></i>Stocks are shares in the ownership of a company. Also known as
                equities, they’re heavily regulated by the government and most can be bought and sold on stock
                exchanges.</li>
              <li><i class="uil uil-arrow-right"></i>Cryptos are digital currencies that can be exchanged online for
                goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these
                can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you
                would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to
                access the good or service.</li>
              <li><i class="uil uil-arrow-right"></i>Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain.
                Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records
                transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.</li>
              <li><i class="uil uil-arrow-right"></i>Bonds are based on debt, and they’re created when an investor
                loans money to a company or governmental entity to finance projects and operations. They’re known as
                fixed income instruments because typically they pay out a regular (fixed) amount (income) to
                investors.</li>
              <li><i class="uil uil-arrow-right"></i>Mutual funds are investment funds that take money from many
                investors and put it into stocks, bonds, money-market funds or other securities or assets. When you
                buy a mutual fund share, you own a piece of the fund’s investment portfolio.</li>
              <li><i class="uil uil-arrow-right"></i>Exchange traded funds (ETFs), like mutual funds, are invested in
                stocks, bonds, money-market funds or other securities or assets, but investors don’t own direct shares
                of these funds. Only authorized participants (financial institutions who double as broker-dealers) own
                direct shares of these investment funds. But these authorized participants in turn offer shares to
                investors that can be bought on a stock exchange. To learn about the net asset and issuance flows of
                mutual funds and ETFs, visit the Investment Company Institute.</li>
